Although mechanisms underlying the development of chemoresistance are still ambiguous, the B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) family is closely associated with chemoresistance in ovarian cancer. We previously disclosed that Zeta-Crystallin (CryZ) is a post-transcriptional regulator of Bcl-2 gene expression, by binding to Bcl-2 mRNA and increasing its half-life. Here, we investigated the role of CryZ as a novel therapeutic target in A2780 ovarian carcinoma cells by modulating the protein activity with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) to restore chemosensitivity. Molecular docking and fragment-mapping based approach revealed potential interaction of ASA within CryZ protein. Inhibition of CryZ binding activity to Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl mRNA targets by ASA was demonstrated in A375 cells. Cytotoxicity assays were conducted in A2780S and A2780R ovarian cancer cells to evaluate if CryZ binding activity inhibition and CryZ silencing were able to reverse cisplatin resistance.

Thus, this study investigated the efficiency of bilateral ultrasound-guided RISS (US-RISS) as a perioperative pain control technique in male subjects receiving gynecomastia surgery. METHODS: This prospective randomized study involved sixty patients who underwent gynecomastia surgery. Individuals were randomly divided into two groups: the RISS group (N.=30) and the control group (N.=30). After anesthesia induction, the patients received bilateral US-RISS using 40 mL of 0.25% levobupivacaine, or conventional intravenous analgesia with no intervention, respectively. The primary outcome was the overall morphine consumption in 24 hours, and the secondary endpoints involved the time elapsed till rescue analgesia was requested, the quality of recovery after 24 hours and side effects' incidence. RESULTS: Morphine consumption was noticeably decreased in the RISS group compared to the control group, with 14.07+/-4.91 mg and 35.83+/-1.70 mg mean values, respectively (P<0.001). Furthermore, in the RISS group, the initial rescue analgesia request occurred significantly later than in the control group, with mean values of 15.58+/-1.41 hours and 0.96+/-0.63 hours, respectively (P<0.001).

This procedure is invasive and causes severe postoperative pain, which can affect the patient's postoperative sleep quality and, thus, the recovery process. AIM: To evaluate use of dezocine in patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) for postoperative pain management in patients undergoing total myomectomy. METHODS: We selected 100 patients undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy for uterine fibroids and randomized them into two groups: A control group receiving 0.2% ropivacaine plus 0.06 mg/mL of morphine and an observation group receiving 0.2% ropivacaine plus 0.3 mg/mL of diazoxide in their PCEA. Outcomes assessed included pain levels, sedation, recovery indices, PCEA usage, stress factors, and sleep quality. RESULTS: The observation group showed lower visual analog scale scores, shorter postoperative recovery indices, fewer mean PCEA compressions, lower cortisol and blood glucose levels, and better polysomnographic parameters compared to the control group (P < 0.05). The cumulative incidence of adverse reactions was lower in the observation group than in the control group (P < 0.05).

The antinociceptive dose of morphine was determined in rats with SCI through the Hargreaves and naloxone-induced morphine withdrawal tests. The rats were then allocated to 5 groups: laminectomy, SCI, SCI + Morphine, SCI + cell therapy, SCI + Morphine + cell therapy.

On day 7, Neural-like stem cells derived from adipose tissue were transplanted intraspinally into the injured animals, and they were monitored for 12 weeks. The outcomes were assessed using the BBB test, somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP), and histology. The BBB test indicated that morphine significantly hindered functional recovery post-cell transplantation compared to animals receiving only cell therapy (p < 0.05). In the SSEP test, the analysis of amplitude and latency of waves did not reveal a significant difference (p > 0.05).

Inhibiting cullin3-RING ligases by blocking the neddylation of cullin3 abolishes heterologous sensitization, however, the modulating mechanism remains uncharted. Here, we report an essential role of the potassium channel tetramerization domain (KCTD) protein 2, 5, and 17, especially the dominant isoform KCTD5 in regulating heterologous sensitization of AC1 and morphine dependence via working with cullin3 and the cullin-associated and neddylation-dissociated 1 (CAND1) protein. In cellular models, we observed enhanced association of KCTD5 with Gbeta and cullin3, along with elevated dissociation of Gbeta from AC1 as well as of CAND1 from cullin3 in heterologous sensitization of AC1. Given binding of CAND1 inhibits the neddylation of cullin3, we further elucidated that the enhanced interaction of KCTD5 with both Gbeta and cullin3 promoted the dissociation of CAND1 from cullin3, attenuated the inhibitory effect of CAND1 on cullin3 neddylation, ultimately resulted in heterologous sensitization of AC1. The paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) plays an important role in mediating morphine dependence. Through pharmacological and biochemical approaches, we then demonstrated that KCTD5/cullin3 regulates morphine dependence via modulating heterologous sensitization of AC, likely AC1 in PVT in mice.

The potential interaction between PPIs and antiplatelet agents has been widely discussed, but doubts remain as to whether PPIs may reduce the cardiovascular protection provided by aspirin, prasugrel, ticagrelor, and clopidogrel. AREAS COVERED: Many pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) studies have confirmed the interaction, especially between PPIs and clopidogrel, but with uncertain consequences on clinical outcomes. Therefore, we aimed to summarize the evidence for the widespread combined use of oral antiplatelet drugs and PPIs, to outline the current evidence supporting or opposing drug-drug interaction, and to discuss the clinical implications of such interactions. EXPERT OPINION: A large body of evidence describes the PK/PD interaction of antiplatelet drugs with PPIs and its potential role in increasing clinical cardiovascular adverse events, but no solid clinical data have confirmed these effects. In the light of the published studies, there seems to be no restriction on the choice of PPI with aspirin, prasugrel, and/or ticagrelor.

Without proper control of pain, individuals can experience poor mobility, increased thromboembolic events, and difficulty caring for the neonate in the postpartum period. There have been multiple methods for pain management for cesarean delivery and intrathecal morphine (ITM) has emerged as a prominent option for post-operative analgesia due to its efficacy, safety, and potential benefits over other treatments. This review analyzes data on efficacy, side effects, and safety of ITM and the pain control alternatives. RECENT FINDINGS: A comprehensive literature review was conducted to compare ITM with other analgesic techniques in post-cesarean patients. ITM was found to be as effective or better than other analgesic options, including bilateral quadratus lumborum block (QLB), opioid-free epidural analgesia (CSEA-EDA), and intravenous fentanyl. One study found that both ITM and oral analgesia were effective in pain control and that ITM caused fewer breakthrough pain events but had a longer duration and a greater rate of side effects than oral opioid analgesia. Commonly observed side effects of intrathecal opioids include nausea, vomiting, pruritus, and urinary retention, and it is thought that the adverse effects from intrathecal administration of opioids are short-lived. ITM may provide a decreased risk of DVT and coagulation by decreasing lower extremity weakness and numbness, thereby decreasing recovery time and increasing mobility.

Existing as two enantiomers, the stereoselective recognition of nicotine by TLR4/MD2 in the context of the innate immune response remains unclear. In this study, we synthesized (+)-nicotine and investigated its effects alongside (-)-nicotine on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced TLR4 signaling. (-)-Nicotine dose-dependently inhibited proinflammatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). In contrast, (+)-nicotine showed no such inhibitory effects. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that (-)-nicotine exhibited a stronger affinity with the TLR4 coreceptor MD2 than (+)-nicotine. Additionally, in silico simulations revealed that both nicotine enantiomers initially attach to the entrance of the MD2 cavity, creating a metastable state before they fully enter the cavity. In the metastable state, (-)-nicotine established more stable interactions with the surrounding residues at the entrance of the MD2 cavity compared to those of (+)-nicotine. This highlights the crucial role of the MD2 cavity entrance in the chiral recognition of nicotine.

We evaluated NOSH-ASA against (ER)-negative breast cancer using cell lines and a xenograft mouse model. NOSH-ASA strongly inhibited growth of MDA-MB-231 and SKBR3 breast cancer cells with low IC(50)s of 90plus minus5 and 82plus minus5 nM, respectively, with marginal effects on a normal breast epithelial cell line.

Building on these findings, we injected the non-selective Hsp90 inhibitor KU-32 by the intrathecal route into male and female CD-1 mice, showing that morphine anti-nociceptive potency was boosted by 1.9-3.5-fold in acute and chronic pain models.

Preventive therapy, whereby natural or synthetic agents are used to prevent, reverse or delay disease development, could be an effective strategy to further reduce cancer risk and potential agents have already been identified in conventional observational studies. However, as such studies are vulnerable to confounding and reverse causation, we aim to evaluate these observed relationships using Mendelian randomization (MR), an alternative causal inference approach which should be less susceptible to these biases. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will use two-sample MR, which uses two independent samples for the exposure and outcome data, to investigate previously reported observational associations of multiple potential preventive agents with CRC risk. We define preventive agents as any synthetic (e.g. approved medication) or natural (e.g. micronutrient, endogenous hormone) molecule used to reduce the risk of cancer. We will first extract potential preventive agents that have been previously linked to CRC risk in observational studies from reviews of the literature.

At present, however, the mechanisms underlying the development of morphine analgesic tolerance are not fully understood. This tolerance is influenced by various opioid receptor and kinase protein modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination. Here, we established a murine morphine tolerance model to investigate whether and how S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) is involved in morphine tolerance. Repeated administration of morphine resulted in the down-regulation of GSNOR, which increased excessive total protein S-nitrosation in the prefrontal cortex. Knockout or chemical inhibition of GSNOR promoted the development of morphine analgesic tolerance and neuron-specific overexpression of GSNOR alleviated morphine analgesic tolerance. Mechanistically, GSNOR deficiency enhanced S-nitrosation of cellular protein kinase alpha (PKCalpha) at the Cys78 and Cys132 sites, leading to inhibition of PKCalpha kinase activity, which ultimately promoted the development of morphine analgesic tolerance.

Previous experiments have shown that the endomorphin-1 analog, ZH853, is a specific micro-opioid receptor agonist with reduced side effects like tolerance and glial activation following chronic central administration in pain-naive animals. Here, we investigated the effects of chronic, peripheral administration of micro-opioid receptor agonists following neuropathic injury. Though micro-opioids are effective at reducing neuropathic pain, they are not recommended for first-line treatment due to negative side effects. Compared with chronic morphine, chronic ZH853 treatment led to decreased tolerance and reduced glial activation. Following twice-daily intravenous injections, morphine was less potent and had a shorter duration of antinociception compared with ZH853.

All study participants were classified into ESUS and non-ESUS groups for the prespecified exploratory analysis. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the interaction of the state of ESUS with the effects of dual antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor-aspirin versus clopidogrel-aspirin, adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical factors. RESULTS: The subgroup analysis comprised 5796 participants (90.4% of the total 6412 participants) in the CHANCE-2 trial, with a median age of 64.9 years (range, 57.0-71.4 years), of whom 1964 (33.9%) were female. These participants underwent diffusion-weighted imaging as part of the study protocol. After systematic evaluation, 15.2% of patients (881/5796) were deemed to have ESUS. The incidence of stroke recurrence in patients with ESUS was found to be 5.6% in the ticagrelor-aspirin group and 9.2% in the clopidogrel-aspirin group (hazard ratio, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.33-0.99]; P=0.04). In patients without ESUS, the respective incidence rates were 5.6% and 7.5% (hazard ratio, 0.72 [95% CI,', 'prediction': 0, 'probability': 0.05292140996318798}, {'title': 'Cannabinoid CB(2) receptors in primary sensory neurons are implicated in CB(2) agonist-mediated suppression of paclitaxel-induced neuropathic nociception and sexually-dimorphic sparing of morphine tolerance.', 'summary': 'Cannabinoid CB(2) agonists show therapeutic efficacy without unwanted CB(1)-mediated side effects.

In this study, we describe two cases of serotonin syndrome-associated hypertensive crisis following linezolid use. CASE PRESENTATION: The first patient was a 52-year-old female who was admitted due to a diabetic foot infection and pneumonia associated with a decreased consciousness level. Serotonin syndrome occurred 24 hours after starting the linezolid use. Resistant hypertension was the main hemodynamic finding. It could not be controlled with amlodipine, valsartan, prazosin, and nitroglycerin infusion. Resistant hypertension and other symptoms of serotonin syndrome were resolved about 48 hours after discontinuation of linezolid use. The second case was a man with a history of kidney transplant, diabetes, and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU due to severe COVID-19 broad-spectrum antibiotics [linezolid, cefepime], and remdesivir was initiated. Following intubation, continuous infusion of fentanyl was used for sedation. Within 24 hours after fentanyl and linezolid initiation, severe agitation, eye clonus, hyperreflexia, hypertension [160-186 /90-110 mmHg], and tachycardia [>100/min] were noted. With the possible diagnosis of serotonin syndrome, fentanyl was discontinued, and morphine was initiated. The patient's symptoms improved 48 hours after discontinuation of fentanyl.

With multisource data, this study sought to determine the effects of morphine interaction with P2Y12 inhibitors on major adverse outcomes comprehensively, and identify the warning indicators. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Interaction signals were sought in 187,919 safety reports from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database, utilizing reporting odds ratios (repOR). In a cohort of 5240 acute coronary syndrome patients, the analyses were validated, and the biological effects of warning indicators were further studied with Mendelian randomization and mediation analysis. RESULTS: Potential risk of renal system adverse events in patients cotreated with morphine is significantly higher in FAERS (repOR 4.83, 95% CI 4.42-5.28, false discovery rate adjusted-P =3.55*10(-209)).

Our study aimed to identify Ca(v)2.3 as a potential target to treat postoperative pain and to reduce opioid-related side effects.

In adult rodents, the delayed effects of stress can increase anxiety-like behavior. These effects, however, can be prevented with post-stress administration of corticosterone (CORT). The effectiveness of CORT in preventing adolescent stress-induced emotional behavior alterations in adulthood has yet to be investigated. OBJECTIVES: Here, we investigated the interactions between early adolescent stress and exogenous corticosterone on adult social, aversive, and drug-seeking behavior in mice, which are translationally related to symptoms associated with psychiatric and substance abuse disorders. METHODS AND RESULTS: A single administration of CORT in drinking water (400ug/mL) for 24 h after social defeat or context fear conditioning prevents defeat-induced social avoidance, alters fear processing, prevents adolescent stress-induced anhedonia, and prevents stress-potentiated morphine place preference in adulthood. Exogenous CORT did not immediately prevent stress-induced potentiation of morphine conditioned-place preference in adolescents but did so in adult mice. However, when administered to adolescent mice, CORT also prevented the incubation of morphine-conditioned place preference into adulthood. Lastly, exogenous CORT administration blunted endogenous corticosterone but was unrelated to freezing behavior during a fear test. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first demonstration of adolescent post-stress CORT promoting socio-emotional resilience and preventing drug-seeking behavior. Our data suggest elevated corticosterone after a stress experience promotes resilience for at least 40 days across the developmental transition from adolescence to adulthood and is effective for socio-emotional and drug-seeking behavior.

Evidence is presented suggesting that a likely cause of IDA in this category of aspirin users is the chelation activity and increased excretion of iron caused by aspirin chelating metabolites (ACMs). It is estimated that 90% of oral aspirin is metabolized into about 70% of the ACMs salicyluric acid, salicylic acid, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid. All ACMs have a high affinity for binding iron and ability to mobilize iron from different iron pools, causing an overall net increase in iron excretion and altering iron balance. Interestingly, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid has been previously tested in iron-loaded thalassaemia patients, leading to substantial increases in iron excretion. The daily administration of low-dose aspirin for long-term periods is likely to enhance the overall iron excretion in small increments each time due to the combined iron mobilization effect of the ACM. In particular, IDA is likely to occur mainly in populations such as elderly vegetarian adults with meals low in iron content. Furthermore, IDA may be exacerbated by the combinations of ACM with other dietary', 'prediction': 0, 'probability': 0.02780423243195704}, {'title': 'A comparison of port-site infiltration with bupivacaine alone vs. bupivacaine plus dexemedetomidine after diagnostic staging laparoscopy.', 'summary': 'OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of bupivacaine alone and in combination with dexmedetomidine following staging laparoscopies.

However, the misuse of opioid analgesics has contributed to the current opioid epidemic in the United States. Prescribed opioids such as morphine, codeine, oxycodone, and fentanyl are mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonists primarily used in the clinic to treat pain or during medical procedures, but development of tolerance limits their utility for treatment of chronic pain. Here we explored the effects of biasing Gbetagamma signaling on tolerance development after chronic morphine treatment in vivo. We hypothesized that biasing Gbetagamma signaling with gallein could prevent activation of regulatory signaling pathways that result in tolerance to antinociceptive effects of MOR agonists. Gallein has been shown to bind to Gbetagamma and inhibit interactions of Gbetagamma with phospholipase-Cbeta3 (PLCbeta3) or G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) but not G-protein inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels. In mice, morphine-induced antinociception was evaluated in the 55 degrees C warm water tail withdrawal assay. We used two paradigms for gallein treatment: administration during and after three times-daily morphine administration.

METHODS: We selected 100 patients undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy for uterine fibroids and randomized them into two groups: A control group receiving 0.2% ropivacaine plus 0.06 mg/mL of morphine and an observation group receiving 0.2% ropivacaine plus 0.3 mg/mL of diazoxide in their PCEA. Outcomes assessed included pain levels, sedation, recovery indices, PCEA usage, stress factors, and sleep quality. RESULTS: The observation group showed lower visual analog scale scores, shorter postoperative recovery indices, fewer mean PCEA compressions, lower cortisol and blood glucose levels, and better polysomnographic parameters compared to the control group (P < 0.05). The cumulative incidence of adverse reactions was lower in the observation group than in the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Dezocine PCEA can effectively control the pain associated with total myomectomy, reduce the negative impact of stress factors, and have less impact on patients' sleep, consequently resulting in fewer adverse effects.", 'prediction': 0, 'probability': 0.035835932704683646}, {'title': 'Low-dose ketamine as an adjunct to morphine: A randomized controlled trial among patients with and without current opioid use.', 'summary': 'BACKGROUND: Pain is a common complaint among patients presenting to the emergency department (ED), yet pain treatment is frequently suboptimal.

Traditional treatment options encounter difficulties due to antibiotic resistance and adverse effects. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the effectiveness of a new treatment plan that combines vonoprazan (VPZ), amoxicillin, and bismuth for the eradication of H. pylori. METHODS: A total of 600 patients infected with H. pylori were recruited for this multicenter randomized controlled trial.

Inhibiting cullin3-RING ligases by blocking the neddylation of cullin3 abolishes heterologous sensitization, however, the modulating mechanism remains uncharted. Here, we report an essential role of the potassium channel tetramerization domain (KCTD) protein 2, 5, and 17, especially the dominant isoform KCTD5 in regulating heterologous sensitization of AC1 and morphine dependence via working with cullin3 and the cullin-associated and neddylation-dissociated 1 (CAND1) protein. In cellular models, we observed enhanced association of KCTD5 with Gbeta and cullin3, along with elevated dissociation of Gbeta from AC1 as well as of CAND1 from cullin3 in heterologous sensitization of AC1. Given binding of CAND1 inhibits the neddylation of cullin3, we further elucidated that the enhanced interaction of KCTD5 with both Gbeta and cullin3 promoted the dissociation of CAND1 from cullin3, attenuated the inhibitory effect of CAND1 on cullin3 neddylation, ultimately resulted in heterologous sensitization of AC1. The paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) plays an important role in mediating morphine dependence.

There have been multiple methods for pain management for cesarean delivery and intrathecal morphine (ITM) has emerged as a prominent option for post-operative analgesia due to its efficacy, safety, and potential benefits over other treatments. This review analyzes data on efficacy, side effects, and safety of ITM and the pain control alternatives. RECENT FINDINGS: A comprehensive literature review was conducted to compare ITM with other analgesic techniques in post-cesarean patients. ITM was found to be as effective or better than other analgesic options, including bilateral quadratus lumborum block (QLB), opioid-free epidural analgesia (CSEA-EDA), and intravenous fentanyl. One study found that both ITM and oral analgesia were effective in pain control and that ITM caused fewer breakthrough pain events but had a longer duration and a greater rate of side effects than oral opioid analgesia. Commonly observed side effects of intrathecal opioids include nausea, vomiting, pruritus, and urinary retention, and it is thought that the adverse effects from intrathecal administration of opioids are short-lived. ITM may provide a decreased risk of DVT and coagulation by decreasing lower extremity weakness and numbness, thereby decreasing recovery time and increasing mobility.

(-)-Nicotine, the primary alkaloid in tobacco and a key component of highly addictive cigarettes, targets the TLR4/MD2, influencing TLR4 signaling pathways. Existing as two enantiomers, the stereoselective recognition of nicotine by TLR4/MD2 in the context of the innate immune response remains unclear. In this study, we synthesized (+)-nicotine and investigated its effects alongside (-)-nicotine on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced TLR4 signaling. (-)-Nicotine dose-dependently inhibited proinflammatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). In contrast, (+)-nicotine showed no such inhibitory effects. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that (-)-nicotine exhibited a stronger affinity with the TLR4 coreceptor MD2 than (+)-nicotine. Additionally, in silico simulations revealed that both nicotine enantiomers initially attach to the entrance of the MD2 cavity, creating a metastable state before they fully enter the cavity. In the metastable state, (-)-nicotine established more stable interactions with the surrounding residues at the entrance of the MD2 cavity compared to those of (+)-nicotine.

METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive the standard quadruple therapy (amoxicillin, clarithromycin, omeprazole and bismuth potassium citrate ) for 2 weeks or 250 mg of avian polyclonal IgY orally twice a day for 4 weeks. The binding efficacy of IgY to H. pylori antigens was detected by western blotting(13). C-urea breath test was performed to evaluate the eradication therap's efficacy. The side effects of IgY were evaluated via various routine tests. The questionnaire was used to gather clinical symptoms and adverse reactions. RESULTS: Western blot analysis showed that tetravalent IgY simultaneously bind to VacA, HpaA, CagA and UreB of H. pylori. Tetravalent IgY had an eradication rate of 50.74% in patients with refractory H. pylori and an inhibition rate of 50.04% against DOB (delta over baseline) of (13)C-urea.

We examined the impact of GAT358 on formalin-evoked pain behavior and Fos protein expression, a marker of neuronal activation, in the lumbar spinal cord. We also assessed the impact of GAT358 on morphine-induced slowing of colonic transit, tolerance, and withdrawal behaviors in male mice. GAT358 attenuated morphine antinociceptive tolerance without blocking acute antinociception and reduced morphine-induced slowing of colonic motility without impacting fecal boli production.

In our earlier work, we showed that Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) has a crucial role in regulating opioid signaling in spinal cord; Hsp90 inhibition in spinal cord enhances opioid anti-nociception. Building on these findings, we injected the non-selective Hsp90 inhibitor KU-32 by the intrathecal route into male and female CD-1 mice, showing that morphine anti-nociceptive potency was boosted by 1.9-3.5-fold in acute and chronic pain models. At the same time, tolerance was reduced from 21-fold to 2.9 fold and established tolerance was rescued, while the potency of constipation and reward was unchanged. These results demonstrate that spinal Hsp90 inhibition can improve the therapeutic index of morphine. However, we also found that systemic non-selective Hsp90 inhibition blocked opioid pain relief. To avoid this effect, we used selective small molecule inhibitors and CRISPR gene editing to identify 3 Hsp90 isoforms active in spinal cord (Hsp90alpha, Hsp90beta, and Grp94) while only Hsp90alpha was active in brain. We thus hypothesized that a systemically delivered selective inhibitor to Hsp90beta or Grp94 could selectively inhibit spinal cord Hsp90 activity, resulting in enhanced opioid therapy. We tested this hypothesis using intravenous delivery of KUNB106 (Hsp90beta) and KUNG65 (Grp94), showing that both drugs enhanced morphine anti-nociceptive potency while rescuing tolerance.

Here, we established a murine morphine tolerance model to investigate whether and how S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) is involved in morphine tolerance.

Indole-3-acetic acid coupled to moderate antibiotic stress could elevate lipid productivity and lipid content of Synechococcus sp. to 33.50 mg/L/day and 43.75%, respectively. Phytohormones increased the pollutant removal performance of the cyanobacteria-bacteria consortium through the stimulation of cyanobacterial growth and the regulation of cyanobacteria-bacteria interaction, which increased the abundances of microalgae-associated bacteria including Flavobacterium, Allorhizobium-Neorhizobium-Pararhizobium-Rhizobium, Bosea, Sphingomonas and Emticicia.

In adult rodents, the delayed effects of stress can increase anxiety-like behavior. These effects, however, can be prevented with post-stress administration of corticosterone (CORT). The effectiveness of CORT in preventing adolescent stress-induced emotional behavior alterations in adulthood has yet to be investigated. OBJECTIVES: Here, we investigated the interactions between early adolescent stress and exogenous corticosterone on adult social, aversive, and drug-seeking behavior in mice, which are translationally related to symptoms associated with psychiatric and substance abuse disorders. METHODS AND RESULTS: A single administration of CORT in drinking water (400ug/mL) for 24 h after social defeat or context fear conditioning prevents defeat-induced social avoidance, alters fear processing, prevents adolescent stress-induced anhedonia, and prevents stress-potentiated morphine place preference in adulthood. Exogenous CORT did not immediately prevent stress-induced potentiation of morphine conditioned-place preference in adolescents but did so in adult mice. However, when administered to adolescent mice, CORT also prevented the incubation of morphine-conditioned place preference into adulthood. Lastly, exogenous CORT administration blunted endogenous corticosterone but was unrelated to freezing behavior during a fear test. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first demonstration of adolescent post-stress CORT promoting socio-emotional resilience and preventing drug-seeking behavior. Our data suggest elevated corticosterone after a stress experience promotes resilience for at least 40 days across the developmental transition from adolescence to adulthood and is effective for socio-emotional and drug-seeking behavior. These results are critical for understanding how adolescent stress impacts emotional and drug-seeking behavior into adulthood.', 'prediction': 0, 'probability': 0.02107395454014637}, {'title': 'Appropriate use of antibiotics for oral/dental conditions in older adults: a narrative review.', 'summary': "OBJECTIVES: Considering the high rates in the use of antibiotics for oral/dental conditions in older patients and the rise in antimicrobial resistance, appropriate antibiotic prescription is important.

This administration method results in no adverse reactions locally, as well as equivalent or lower systemic complications compared with other vancomycin administration methods(4). Intraosseous infusion of prophylactic surgical antibiotics has been shown to be more effective than intravenous administration, with the potential for reduction in surgical site infections(5). DESCRIPTION: After the operative extremity has been prepared and draped in the usual sterile fashion, the limb is elevated and the tourniquet is inflated to 250 mm Hg.

However, the misuse of opioid analgesics has contributed to the current opioid epidemic in the United States. Prescribed opioids such as morphine, codeine, oxycodone, and fentanyl are mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonists primarily used in the clinic to treat pain or during medical procedures, but development of tolerance limits their utility for treatment of chronic pain. Here we explored the effects of biasing Gbetagamma signaling on tolerance development after chronic morphine treatment in vivo. We hypothesized that biasing Gbetagamma signaling with gallein could prevent activation of regulatory signaling pathways that result in tolerance to antinociceptive effects of MOR agonists. Gallein has been shown to bind to Gbetagamma and inhibit interactions of Gbetagamma with phospholipase-Cbeta3 (PLCbeta3) or G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) but not G-protein inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels. In mice, morphine-induced antinociception was evaluated in the 55 degrees C warm water tail withdrawal assay. We used two paradigms for gallein treatment: administration during and after three times-daily morphine administration. Our results show that gallein cotreatment during repeated administration of morphine decreased opioid tolerance development and that gallein treatment in an opioid-tolerant state enhanced the potency of morphine. Mechanistically, our data suggest that PLCbeta3 is necessary for potentiating effects of gallein in an opioid-tolerant state but not in preventing the development of tolerance.

We found that adolescent THC administration impacted morphine-induced behaviors across several dimensions, including potentiating reward and paradoxically impairing the development of morphine reward. We then mapped the whole-brain response to a reinstatement dose of morphine, finding that adolescent THC administration led to increased activity in the basal ganglia and increased functional connectivity between frontal cortical regions and the ventral tegmental area. Last, we show using rabies virus-based circuit mapping that adolescent THC exposure triggers a long-lasting elevation in connectivity from the frontal cortex regions onto ventral tegmental dopamine cells that has the potential to influence dopaminergic response to morphine administration during adulthood. Our study adds to the rich literature on the interaction between drugs of abuse and provides potential circuit substates by which adolescent THC exposure influences responses to morphine later in life.', 'prediction': 0, 'probability': 0.03230090521031075}, {'title': 'Effect of perioperative intravenous ibuprofen versus acetaminophen on postoperative opioid consumption and pain after general anesthesia: a systematic review and meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis of randomized controlled trials.', 'summary': 'BACKGROUND: Ibuprofen and acetaminophen are widely used as adjuvant analgesics for postoperative pain. This meta-analysis compared the effects of intravenous (IV) ibuprofen and acetaminophen on postoperative opioid consumption and pain intensity after general anesthesia. METHODS: PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched to identify relevant studies published up to May 2023. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of perioperative IV ibuprofen and acetaminophen on postoperative opioid consumption and pain after general anesthesia were included in the meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis (TSA). RESULTS: Eight studies with 494 participants were included. Compared to IV acetaminophen, IV ibuprofen significantly reduced 24 h opioid consumption, presented as morphine equivalents (mean difference [MD]: -6.01 mg, 95% CI [-8.60, -3.42], P < 0.00001, I2 = 55%), and pain scores (on a scale of 0-10) at 4-6 h (MD: -0.83, 95% CI [-1.29, -0.37], P = 0.0004, I2 = 65%) and 12 h (MD: -0.38, 95% CI [-0.68, -0.08], P = 0.01, I2 = 11%) postoperatively.

We recently reported a bifunctional peptide-based hybrid LENART01 combining dermorphin and ranatensin pharmacophores, which displays activity to the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) and dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) in rat brains and spinal cords. In this study, we investigated the in vitro binding and functional activities to the human MOR and the in vivo pharmacology of LENART01 in mice after subcutaneous administration. In vitro binding assays showed LENART01 to bind and be selective to the human MOR over the other opioid receptor subtypes and delta, kappa and nociceptin receptors. In the [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assay, LENART01 acted as a potent and full agonist to the human MOR. In mice, LENART01 produced dose-dependent antinociceptive effects in formalin-induced inflammatory pain, with increased potency than morphine. Antinociceptive effects were reversed by naloxone, indicating MOR activation in vivo. Behavioral studies also demonstrated LENART01's properties to induce less adverse effects without locomotor dysfunction and withdrawal syndrome compared to conventional opioid analgesics, such as morphine. LENART01 is the first peptide-based MOR-D2R ligand known to date and the first dual MOR-dopamine D2R ligand for which in vivo pharmacology is reported with antinociceptive efficacy and reduced opioid-related side effects.

Multiple genetic drivers of PPQ resistance have been reported, including mutations in the Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt) and increased copies of plasmepsin II/III (pm2/3). We generated a cross between a Cambodia-derived multidrug-resistant KEL1/PLA1 lineage isolate (KH004) and a drug-susceptible Malawian parasite (Mal31). Mal31 harbors a wild-type (3D7-like) pfcrt allele and a single copy of pm2/3, while KH004 has a chloroquine-resistant (Dd2-like) pfcrt allele with an additional G367C substitution and multiple copies of pm2/3. We recovered 104 unique recombinant parasites and examined a targeted set of progeny representing all possible combinations of variants at pfcrt and pm2/3. We performed a detailed analysis of competitive fitness and a range of PPQ susceptibility phenotypes with these progenies, including PPQ survival assay, area under the dose response curve, and a limited point IC(50). We find that inheritance of the KH004 pfcrt allele is required for reduced PPQ sensitivity, whereas copy number variation in pm2/3 further decreases susceptibility but does not confer resistance in the absence of additional mutations in pfcrt. A deep investigation of genotype-phenotype relationships demonstrates that progeny clones from experimental crosses can be used to understand the relative contributions of pfcrt, pm2/3, and parasite genetic background to a range of PPQ-related traits. Additionally, we find that the resistance phenotype associated with parasites inheriting the G367C substitution in pfcrt is consistent with previously validated PPQ resistance mutations in this transporter.IMPORTANCEResistance to piperaquine, used in combination with', 'prediction': 0, 'probability': 0.0064452632880970355}, {'title': 'Tumor-Targeted cRGD-Coated Liposomes Encapsulating Optimized Synergistic Cepharanthine and IR783 for Chemotherapy and Photothermal Therapy.', 'summary': 'BACKGROUND: Combination therapy offers superior therapeutic results compared to monotherapy. However, the outcomes of combination therapy often fall short of expectations, mainly because of increased toxicity from drug interactions and challenges in achieving the desired spatial and temporal distribution of drug delivery. Optimizing synergistic drug combination ratios to ensure uniform targeting and distribution across space and time, particularly in vivo, is a significant challenge. In this study, cRGD-coated liposomes encapsulating optimized synergistic cepharanthine (CEP; a chemotherapy drug) and IR783 (a phototherapy agent) were developed for combined chemotherapy and photothermal therapy in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: An MTT assay was used to evaluate the combination index of CEP and IR783 in five cell lines. The cRGD-encapsulated liposomes were prepared via thin-film hydration, and unencapsulated liposomes served as controls for the loading of CEP and IR783. Fluorescence and photothermal imaging were used to assess the efficacy of CEP and IR783 encapsulated in liposomes at an optimal synergistic ratio, both in vitro and in vivo.

Through experimental analysis, we propose a hypothesis that inappropriate antibiotic use may exacerbate resistance by affecting vesicle formation and protein secretion. Experimental results demonstrate that under the influence of amoxicillin, the concentration of proteins secreted in outer membrane vehicles (OMVs) by ESBL-EC significantly increases, along with a significant upregulation in the expression of the CTX-M-55-type Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (CTX-M-55).

Consequently, the objective of this study is to ascertain whether perioperative administration of esketamine can effectively mitigate the occurrence of POFS in patients undergoing laparoscopic radical gastrectomy. METHODS: A total of 133 patients diagnosed with gastric cancer were randomly assigned to two groups, namely the control group (Group C) (n = 66) and the esketamine group (Group E) (n = 67), using a double-blind method. The Group C received standardized anesthesia, while the Group E received esketamine in addition to the standardized anesthesia.

Our aim in the present study was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of KYNA-loaded micelles (KYNA-MICs) against PD in vitro and in vivo. Lipid-based micelles (MICs) in conjunction with KYNA drug delivery have the potential to enhance the penetration of therapeutic drugs into a diseased brain without BBB obstacles. KYNA-MICs were characterized by particle size (105.8 +/- 12.1 nm), loading efficiency (78.3 +/- 4.23%), and in vitro drug release (approximately 30% at 24 h). The in vitro experiments showed that KYNA-MICs effectively reduced 2-fold protein aggregation. The in vivo studies revealed that KYNA was successfully delivered by 5-fold increase in neurotoxin-induced PD brains. The results showed significant enhancement of KYNA delivery into brain. We also found that the KYNA-MICs exhibited several therapeutic effects. The KYNA-MICs reduced protein aggregation of an in vitro PD model, ameliorated motor functions, and prevented loss of the striatal neurons in a PD animal model.

However, trial design is complex in this population with negative diagnosis of classical hippocampal amnesia on standard memory tests. Besides recent advances in brain imaging, electroencephalogram, and fluid-based biomarkers, new cognitive markers should be established for earlier diagnosis that can optimize recruitment to BACE1 inhibitor trials in presymptomatic AD. Notably, accelerated long-term forgetting (ALF) is emerging as a sensitive cognitive measure that can discriminate between asymptomatic individuals with high risks for developing AD and healthy controls. ALF is a form of declarative memory impairment characterized by increased forgetting rates over longer delays (days to months) despite normal storage within the standard delays of testing (20-60 min). Therefore, ALF may represent a harbinger of preclinical dementia and the impairment of systems memory consolidation, during which memory traces temporarily stored in the hippocampus become gradually integrated into cortical networks.

This study aimed to develop a human AD CO model using normal human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) that recapitulates the pathological phenotypes of AD and to determine the usefulness of this model for drug screening. METHODS: We established AD hPSC lines from normal hPSCs by introducing genes that harbor familial AD mutations, and the COs were generated using these hPSC lines. The pathological features of AD, including extensive amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration, were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Amylo-Glo staining, thioflavin-S staining, immunohistochemistry, Bielschowsky's staining, and western blot analysis. RESULTS: The AD COs exhibited extensive Abeta accumulation. The levels of paired helical filament tau and neurofibrillary tangle-like silver deposits were highly increased in the AD COs. The number of cells immunoreactive for cleaved caspase-3 was significantly increased in the AD COs. In addition, treatment of AD COs with BACE1 inhibitor IV, a beta-secretase inhibitor, and compound E, a gamma-secretase inhibitor, significantly attenuated the AD pathological features. CONCLUSION: Our model effectively recapitulates AD pathology.

Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) therapy offers a desirable approach to antithrombosis through a reduction of platelet reactivity. However, major bleeding complications, severe off-target side effects, and resistance or nonresponse to ASA greatly attenuate its clinical outcomes. Herein, we report a cationic fibrinogen-mimicking nanoparticle, denoted as ASA-RGD-CS@TPP, to achieve activated-platelet-targeted delivery and efficient release of ASA for safer and more effective antithrombotic therapy. This biomimetic antithrombotic system was prepared by one-pot ionic gelation between cationic arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD)-grafted chitosan (RGD-CS) and anionic tripolyphosphate (TPP). The platform exhibited selective binding to activated platelets, leading to efficient release of ASA and subsequent attenuation of platelet functions, including the remarkable inhibition of platelet aggregation through a potent blockage of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1). After intravenous administration, ASA-RGD-CS@TPP displayed significantly prolonged circulation time and successful prevention of thrombosis in a mouse model. ASA-RGD-CS@TPP was demonstrated to significantly enhance antithrombotic therapy while showing minimal coagulation and hemorrhagic risks and excellent biocompatibility in vivo as compared to free ASA.

Its sequence is SGVYKVAYDWQH, similar to a native NTRK2 ligand, that is, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The current study was performed to recognize and confirm critical residues for RNYK activity in a glaucoma-on-a-chip model. METHODS: We designed a modified RNYK (mRNYK) peptide based on hotspots of the RNYK sequence identified by alanine scanning. The critical residues consisted of tyrosine, valine, aspartic acid, and tryptophan (YVDW); however, lysine and glutamine were also maintained in the final sequence (YKVDWQ) for forming amide bonds and peptide dimerization. The affinity of mRNYK binding was confirmed by testing against NTRK2 receptors on the surface of ATRA-treated SH-SY5Y cells. The neuroprotective effect of mRNYK was also evaluated in cell culture after elevated pressure insult in a glaucoma-on-a-chip model. RESULTS: The primary amine on the lysine side-chain from one sequence (YKVDWQ) reacted with a gamma-carboxamide group of glutamine from the other sequence, forming dimeric mRNYK.

Vonoprazan is a potassium-competitive acid blocker renowned for its rapid and long-lasting acid suppression, which is minimally affected by mealtime. Compared to proton pump inhibitors, which bind irreversibly to cysteine residues in the H(+)/K(+)-ATPase pump, Vonoprazan competes with the K(+) ions, prevents the ions from binding to the pump and blocks acid secretion. Concerns with increasing antibiotic resistance, effects on the gut microbiota, patient compliance, and side effects have led to the advent of a dual regimen for H. pylori. Previous studies suggested that S. boulardii plays a role in stabilizing the gut barrier which improves H. pylori eradication rate. With an acceptable safety profile, the dual-adjunct regimen was effective regardless of prior treatment failure and antibiotic resistance profile, thereby strengthening the applicability in clinical settings.

We probe the molecular basis of selectivity of an allosteric inhibitor (MSC1609119A-1) of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor kinase (IGF1RK), which has been shown to be ineffective for the homologous insulin receptor kinase (IRK). Specifically, we investigated the structural and energetic basis of the allosteric binding of this inhibitor to each kinase by combining molecular modeling, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and thermodynamic calculations. We predict the inhibitor conformation in the binding pocket of IRK and highlight that the charged residues in the histidine-arginine-aspartic acid (HRD) and aspartic acid-phenylalanine-glycine (DFG) motifs and the nonpolar residues in the binding pocket govern inhibitor interactions in the allosteric pocket of each kinase. We suggest that the conformational changes in the IGF1RK residues M1054 and M1079, movement of the ⍺C-helix, and the conformational stabilization of the DFG motif favor the selectivity of the inhibitor toward IGF1RK. Our thermodynamic calculations reveal that the observed selectivity can be rationalized through differences observed in the electrostatic interaction energy of the inhibitor in each inhibitor/kinase complex and the hydrogen bonding interactions of the inhibitor with the residue V1063 in IGF1RK that are not attained with the corresponding residue V1060 in IRK.

With the study on the effect of the reaction temperature, pH values, and reaction time, the ideal reaction condition for accumulation of Asn-Glc-ARP was determined at 100 degrees C for 40 min under pH 7. Asparagine (Asn) was prone to degrade from Asn-Glc-ARP in alkaline pH values within a lower temperature range, while in an acidic environment with high temperatures, deamidation of Asn-Glc-ARP to Asp-Glc-ARP (Amadori rearrangement products of aspartic acid with glucose) was displayed as the dominant pathway.

We included 166 studies assessing the impact of food, beverages, antacids or mineral supplements on the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters or PK/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) indices. RESULTS: Eighteen of 25 beta-lactams for which data on food impact were available had clinically important interactions. We observed the highest negative influence of food (AUC or Cmax decreased by >40%) for ampicillin, cefaclor (immediate-release formulations), cefroxadine, cefradine, cloxacillin, oxacillin, penicillin V (liquid formulations and tablets) and sultamicillin, whereas the highest positive influence (AUC or Cmax increased by >45%) for cefditoren pivoxil, cefuroxime and tebipenem pivoxil (extended-release tablets). Significantly lower bioavailability in the presence of antacids or mineral supplements occurred for 4 of 13 analysed beta-lactams, with the highest negative impact for cefdinir (with iron salts) and moderate for cefpodoxime proxetil (with antacids). Data on beverage impact were limited to 11 antibiotics.

This is magnified by insufficient allergy specialists and lack of 'point-of-care' tests. We investigated the feasibility of non-allergy healthcare professionals (HCPs) delivering direct oral penicillin challenges (DPCs) for penicillin allergy de-labelling. METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted in three hospitals in England across three settings (acute medical, pre-surgical and haematology-oncology).

In this study, we identified klebicin E (KlebE), a small bacteriocin derived from Klebsiella pneumoniae. KlebE exhibited strong efficacy against multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates and conferred a significant growth advantage to the producing strain during intraspecies competition. A giant unilamellar vesicle leakage assay demonstrated the unique membrane permeabilization effect of KlebE, suggesting that it is a pore-forming toxin. In addition to a C-terminal toxic domain, KlebE also has a disordered N-terminal domain and a globular central domain. Pulldown assays and soft agar overlay experiments revealed the essential role of the outer membrane porin OmpC and the Ton system in KlebE recognition and cytotoxicity. Strong binding between KlebE and both OmpC and TonB was observed. The TonB-box, a crucial component of the toxin-TonB interaction, was identified as the 7-amino acid sequence (E3ETLTVV9) located in the N-terminal region. Further studies showed that a region near the bottom of the central domain of KlebE plays a primary role in recognizing OmpC, with eight residues surrounding this region identified as essential for KlebE toxicity. Finally, based on the discrepancies in OmpC sequences between the KlebE-resistant and sensitive strains, it was found that the 91st residue of OmpC, an aspartic acid residue, is a key determinant of KlebE toxicity.

Here, we investigated the role of CryZ as a novel therapeutic target in A2780 ovarian carcinoma cells by modulating the protein activity with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) to restore chemosensitivity. Molecular docking and fragment-mapping based approach revealed potential interaction of ASA within CryZ protein. Inhibition of CryZ binding activity to Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl mRNA targets by ASA was demonstrated in A375 cells. Cytotoxicity assays were conducted in A2780S and A2780R ovarian cancer cells to evaluate if CryZ binding activity inhibition and CryZ silencing were able to reverse cisplatin resistance. ASA-treatment determined a downregulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl mRNA levels in A2780S and A2780R cells. ASA-treatment or CryZ silencing were able to increase and restore the chemosensitivity in both sensitive and resistant A2780 ovarian cancer cells, respectively. In this research article we demonstrated that the pharmacological or genetic inhibition of CryZ restores the sensitivity to cisplatin in a model of sensitive or resistant ovarian cancer cells.

Thus, this study investigated the efficiency of bilateral ultrasound-guided RISS (US-RISS) as a perioperative pain control technique in male subjects receiving gynecomastia surgery. METHODS: This prospective randomized study involved sixty patients who underwent gynecomastia surgery. Individuals were randomly divided into two groups: the RISS group (N.=30) and the control group (N.=30). After anesthesia induction, the patients received bilateral US-RISS using 40 mL of 0.25% levobupivacaine, or conventional intravenous analgesia with no intervention, respectively. The primary outcome was the overall morphine consumption in 24 hours, and the secondary endpoints involved the time elapsed till rescue analgesia was requested, the quality of recovery after 24 hours and side effects' incidence. RESULTS: Morphine consumption was noticeably decreased in the RISS group compared to the control group, with 14.07+/-4.91 mg and 35.83+/-1.70 mg mean values, respectively (P<0.001). Furthermore, in the RISS group, the initial rescue analgesia request occurred significantly later than in the control group, with mean values of 15.58+/-1.41 hours and 0.96+/-0.63 hours, respectively (P<0.001).

Patients who experience excessive menstruation, anemia, and pressure symptoms should be administered medication, and severe cases require a total hysterectomy. This procedure is invasive and causes severe postoperative pain, which can affect the patient's postoperative sleep quality and, thus, the recovery process. AIM: To evaluate use of dezocine in patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) for postoperative pain management in patients undergoing total myomectomy. METHODS: We selected 100 patients undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy for uterine fibroids and randomized them into two groups: A control group receiving 0.2% ropivacaine plus 0.06 mg/mL of morphine and an observation group receiving 0.2% ropivacaine plus 0.3 mg/mL of diazoxide in their PCEA. Outcomes assessed included pain levels, sedation, recovery indices, PCEA usage, stress factors, and sleep quality. RESULTS: The observation group showed lower visual analog scale scores, shorter postoperative recovery indices, fewer mean PCEA compressions, lower cortisol and blood glucose levels, and better polysomnographic parameters compared to the control group (P < 0.05). The cumulative incidence of adverse reactions was lower in the observation group than in the control group (P < 0.05).

Inhibiting cullin3-RING ligases by blocking the neddylation of cullin3 abolishes heterologous sensitization, however, the modulating mechanism remains uncharted. Here, we report an essential role of the potassium channel tetramerization domain (KCTD) protein 2, 5, and 17, especially the dominant isoform KCTD5 in regulating heterologous sensitization of AC1 and morphine dependence via working with cullin3 and the cullin-associated and neddylation-dissociated 1 (CAND1) protein. In cellular models, we observed enhanced association of KCTD5 with Gbeta and cullin3, along with elevated dissociation of Gbeta from AC1 as well as of CAND1 from cullin3 in heterologous sensitization of AC1. Given binding of CAND1 inhibits the neddylation of cullin3, we further elucidated that the enhanced interaction of KCTD5 with both Gbeta and cullin3 promoted the dissociation of CAND1 from cullin3, attenuated the inhibitory effect of CAND1 on cullin3 neddylation, ultimately resulted in heterologous sensitization of AC1. The paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) plays an important role in mediating morphine dependence.

Aspirin, a prototypical anti-cancer agent with deleterious side effects, has been modified to release nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide, called NOSH-aspirin (NOSH-ASA), generating a 'safer' class of new anti-inflammatory agents. We evaluated NOSH-ASA against (ER)-negative breast cancer using cell lines and a xenograft mouse model. NOSH-ASA strongly inhibited growth of MDA-MB-231 and SKBR3 breast cancer cells with low IC(50)s of 90plus minus5 and 82plus minus5 nM, respectively, with marginal effects on a normal breast epithelial cell line. NOSH-ASA inhibited cell proliferation, caused G(0)/G(1) phase arrest, increased apoptosis, and was associated with increases in ROS.

In our earlier work, we showed that Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) has a crucial role in regulating opioid signaling in spinal cord; Hsp90 inhibition in spinal cord enhances opioid anti-nociception. Building on these findings, we injected the non-selective Hsp90 inhibitor KU-32 by the intrathecal route into male and female CD-1 mice, showing that morphine anti-nociceptive potency was boosted by 1.9-3.5-fold in acute and chronic pain models. At the same time, tolerance was reduced from 21-fold to 2.9 fold and established tolerance was rescued, while the potency of constipation and reward was unchanged. These results demonstrate that spinal Hsp90 inhibition can improve the therapeutic index of morphine. However, we also found that systemic non-selective Hsp90 inhibition blocked opioid pain relief. To avoid this effect, we used selective small molecule inhibitors and CRISPR gene editing to identify 3 Hsp90 isoforms active in spinal cord (Hsp90alpha, Hsp90beta, and Grp94) while only Hsp90alpha was active in brain. We thus hypothesized that a systemically delivered selective inhibitor to Hsp90beta or Grp94 could selectively inhibit spinal cord Hsp90 activity, resulting in enhanced opioid therapy.

Chronic morphine, but not chronic ZH853, elevated markers of activation/inflammation of astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein), microglia (ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1), the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase p38 (pp38). By contrast, chronic ZH853 reduced ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha relative to both morphine and vehicle, suggesting anti-inflammatory properties with respect to these markers. Glial fibrillary acidic protein and pp38 were not significantly different from vehicle but were significantly lower than morphine.

Peptic ulcer disease is usually attributable to Helicobacter pylori infection, intake of some medications (such as aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications), or being critically ill (stress-related), or it can be idiopathic. The clinical presentation is usually uncomplicated, with peptic ulcer disease management based on eradicating H pylori if present, the use of acid-suppressing medications-most often proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)-or addressing complications, such as with early endoscopy and high-dose PPIs for peptic ulcer bleeding. Special considerations apply to patients on antiplatelet and antithrombotic agents. H pylori treatment has evolved, with the choice of regimen dictated by local antibiotic resistance patterns. Indications for primary and secondary prophylaxis vary across societies; most suggest PPIs for patients at highest risk of developing a peptic ulcer, its complications, or its recurrence. Additional research areas include the use of potassium-competitive acid blockers and H pylori vaccination; the optimal approach for patients at risk of stress ulcer bleeding requires more robust determinations of optimal patient selection and treatment selection, if any.

This study aims to compare the efficacy and safety of intravenous (IV) meperidine and morphine is treatment of MAB-related rigors, filling a significant gap in the literature. METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study which reviewed patients either inpatient or within outpatient infusion centers from January 2015 to January 2024. Patients receiving IV 2 mg morphine or 25 mg meperidine for MAB-related rigors were included. The primary outcome was defined as the number of opioid doses required for rigors ablation. Secondary outcomes included rates of naloxone administration and documented sedation. RESULTS: A total of 1251 administration events were screened, of which 127 and 26 rigor events were in the meperidine and morphine cohorts, respectively, were included. A majority of both cohorts required only one dose of either agent for rigors ablation with <20% of either cohort requiring 2 or more doses (p = 0.539).

METHODS: To achieve this goal, we developed Tet1-LNP (morphine), a neural-targeting lipid nanoparticle encapsulating morphine that could specifically activate the peripheral opioid receptor in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and significantly reduce the side effects caused by the activation of opioid receptors in the brain. Tet1-LNP (morphine) were successfully prepared using the thin-film hydration method. In vitro, Tet1-LNP (morphine) uptake was assessed in differentiated neuron-like PC-12 cells and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) primary cells. The uptake of Tet1-LNP (morphine) in the DRGs and the brain was assessed in vivo. Von Frey filament and Hargreaves tests were used to assess the antinociception of Tet1-LNP (morphine) in the chronic constriction injury (CCI) neuropathic pain model.

However, Several clinical studies with cardiovascular events as an outcome are contradictory, and the broader impact of this drug interaction on additional organ systems remains uncertain. With multisource data, this study sought to determine the effects of morphine interaction with P2Y12 inhibitors on major adverse outcomes comprehensively, and identify the warning indicators. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Interaction signals were sought in 187,919 safety reports from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database, utilizing reporting odds ratios (repOR). In a cohort of 5240 acute coronary syndrome patients, the analyses were validated, and the biological effects of warning indicators were further studied with Mendelian randomization and mediation analysis. RESULTS: Potential risk of renal system adverse events in patients cotreated with morphine is significantly higher in FAERS (repOR 4.83, 95% CI 4.42-5.28, false discovery rate adjusted-P =3.55*10(-209)). The analysis of in-house patient cohorts validated these results with an increased risk of acute kidney injury (adjusted OR: 1.65; 95% CI: 1.20 to 2.26), and we also found a risk of myocardial infarction in patients treated with morphine (adjusted OR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.14 to 2.11).

Our study aimed to identify Ca(v)2.3 as a potential target to treat postoperative pain and to reduce opioid-related side effects. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: A plantar incision model was established in adult male and female C57BL/6 mice. Ca(v)2.3 expression was detected by qPCR and suppressed by siRNA treatment. The antinociceptive efficacy and safety of a Ca(v)2.3 blocker-alone or together with morphine-was also assessed after surgery. KEY RESULTS: Paw incision in female and male mice caused acute nociception and increased Ca(v)2.3 mRNA expression in the spinal cord but not in the incised tissue. Intrathecal treatment with siRNA against Ca(v)2.3, but not with a scrambled siRNA, prevented the development of surgery-induced nociception in both male and female mice, with female mice experiencing long-lasting effects. High doses of i.t. SNX-482, a Ca(v)2.3 channel blocker, or morphine injected alone, reversed postoperative nociception but also induced side effects. A combination of lower doses of morphine and SNX-482 mediated a long-lasting reversal of postsurgical pain in female and male mice.

We investigated whether low-frequency administration of omeprazole could effectively repair aspirin-induced mucosal damage and reduce the increase in gastrin levels associated with long-term use of PPIs. METHODS: Sprague‒Dawley rats were divided into four treatment groups: daily aspirin, daily aspirin and omeprazole once every day (qd), daily aspirin and omeprazole once every other day (qod), and daily aspirin and omeprazole once every three days (1/d3). After 15 days of feeding, blood samples were collected, and the stomachs of sacrificed rats were subjected to macroscopic, histological, and immunohistochemical studies.

In adult rodents, the delayed effects of stress can increase anxiety-like behavior. These effects, however, can be prevented with post-stress administration of corticosterone (CORT). The effectiveness of CORT in preventing adolescent stress-induced emotional behavior alterations in adulthood has yet to be investigated. OBJECTIVES: Here, we investigated the interactions between early adolescent stress and exogenous corticosterone on adult social, aversive, and drug-seeking behavior in mice, which are translationally related to symptoms associated with psychiatric and substance abuse disorders. METHODS AND RESULTS: A single administration of CORT in drinking water (400ug/mL) for 24 h after social defeat or context fear conditioning prevents defeat-induced social avoidance, alters fear processing, prevents adolescent stress-induced anhedonia, and prevents stress-potentiated morphine place preference in adulthood. Exogenous CORT did not immediately prevent stress-induced potentiation of morphine conditioned-place preference in adolescents but did so in adult mice. However, when administered to adolescent mice, CORT also prevented the incubation of morphine-conditioned place preference into adulthood. Lastly, exogenous CORT administration blunted endogenous corticosterone but was unrelated to freezing behavior during a fear test. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first demonstration of adolescent post-stress CORT promoting socio-emotional resilience and preventing drug-seeking behavior. Our data suggest elevated corticosterone after a stress experience promotes resilience for at least 40 days across the developmental transition from adolescence to adulthood and is effective for socio-emotional and drug-seeking behavior.

The mechanisms of the cause of IDA in this category of individuals are still largely unknown. Evidence is presented suggesting that a likely cause of IDA in this category of aspirin users is the chelation activity and increased excretion of iron caused by aspirin chelating metabolites (ACMs). It is estimated that 90% of oral aspirin is metabolized into about 70% of the ACMs salicyluric acid, salicylic acid, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid. All ACMs have a high affinity for binding iron and ability to mobilize iron from different iron pools, causing an overall net increase in iron excretion and altering iron balance. Interestingly, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid has been previously tested in iron-loaded thalassaemia patients, leading to substantial increases in iron excretion. The daily administration of low-dose aspirin for long-term periods is likely to enhance the overall iron excretion in small increments each time due to the combined iron mobilization effect of the ACM. In particular, IDA is likely to occur mainly in populations such as elderly vegetarian adults with meals low in iron content.

We found the co-expressions of TRPV1 and opioid mu, delta and kappa receptors in adult rat cardiomyocytes. Intravenous injection of morphine (0.3 mg/kg) at 20 min after induction of myocardial ischemia, in the rat model of acute myocardial ischemia and reperfusion, induced significant reduction of phosphorylated TRPV1 (p-TRPV1) in the ventricular myocardium and increase in serum cardiac troponin I (cTnI), compared with the ischemia/reperfusion controls (all P < 0.05). The effects of morphine were completely reversed by selective opioid mu, delta and kappa receptor antagonists.

Ultrasound-guided pectoral type-II (PEC II) block is increasingly being used to address acute postoperative pain after breast cancer surgery. However, to date, not many studies have been done regarding prolonging the duration of analgesia of PEC II blocks for postoperative pain relief in patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy (MRM).

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the perioperative application of TEAS in adults compared with sham-TEAS and/or non-TEAS were eligible. Cumulative analgesic consumption within 24 h and rest pain scores at 2, 6, 12, and 24 h postoperatively were the two co-primary outcomes. RESULTS: Seventy-six RCTs (n = 9,665 patients) were included.

Here, we report an essential role of the potassium channel tetramerization domain (KCTD) protein 2, 5, and 17, especially the dominant isoform KCTD5 in regulating heterologous sensitization of AC1 and morphine dependence via working with cullin3 and the cullin-associated and neddylation-dissociated 1 (CAND1) protein. In cellular models, we observed enhanced association of KCTD5 with Gbeta and cullin3, along with elevated dissociation of Gbeta from AC1 as well as of CAND1 from cullin3 in heterologous sensitization of AC1. Given binding of CAND1 inhibits the neddylation of cullin3, we further elucidated that the enhanced interaction of KCTD5 with both Gbeta and cullin3 promoted the dissociation of CAND1 from cullin3, attenuated the inhibitory effect of CAND1 on cullin3 neddylation, ultimately resulted in heterologous sensitization of AC1. The paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) plays an important role in mediating morphine dependence. Through pharmacological and biochemical approaches, we then demonstrated that KCTD5/cullin3 regulates morphine dependence via modulating heterologous sensitization of AC, likely AC1 in PVT in mice. In summary, the present study revealed the underlying mechanism of heterologous sensitization of AC1 mediated by cullin3 and discovered the role of KCTD proteins in regulating morphine dependence in mice.', 'symptoms': [], 'prediction': 0, 'probability': 0.02948806722197265}, {'title': 'Pharmacodynamic Comparison of Two Aspirin Formulations in the Caribbean: The ARC Study.', 'summary': 'INTRODUCTION: This prospective, single-arm, crossover pharmacodynamic study assessed the effect of Bayer((R)) low-dose enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg tablets (LD EC-ASA) (Bayer AG, Leverkusen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany) compared to Vazalore((R)) low-dose phospholipid-aspirin liquid-filled 81 mg capsules (LD PL-ASA) (PLx Pharma Inc., Sparta, NJ, USA) on platelet reactivity with respect to aspirin reaction units (ARU).

There have been multiple methods for pain management for cesarean delivery and intrathecal morphine (ITM) has emerged as a prominent option for post-operative analgesia due to its efficacy, safety, and potential benefits over other treatments. This review analyzes data on efficacy, side effects, and safety of ITM and the pain control alternatives. RECENT FINDINGS: A comprehensive literature review was conducted to compare ITM with other analgesic techniques in post-cesarean patients. ITM was found to be as effective or better than other analgesic options, including bilateral quadratus lumborum block (QLB), opioid-free epidural analgesia (CSEA-EDA), and intravenous fentanyl. One study found that both ITM and oral analgesia were effective in pain control and that ITM caused fewer breakthrough pain events but had a longer duration and a greater rate of side effects than oral opioid analgesia. Commonly observed side effects of intrathecal opioids include nausea, vomiting, pruritus, and urinary retention, and it is thought that the adverse effects from intrathecal administration of opioids are short-lived. ITM may provide a decreased risk of DVT and coagulation by decreasing lower extremity weakness and numbness, thereby decreasing recovery time and increasing mobility.

Existing as two enantiomers, the stereoselective recognition of nicotine by TLR4/MD2 in the context of the innate immune response remains unclear. In this study, we synthesized (+)-nicotine and investigated its effects alongside (-)-nicotine on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced TLR4 signaling. (-)-Nicotine dose-dependently inhibited proinflammatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). In contrast, (+)-nicotine showed no such inhibitory effects. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that (-)-nicotine exhibited a stronger affinity with the TLR4 coreceptor MD2 than (+)-nicotine. Additionally, in silico simulations revealed that both nicotine enantiomers initially attach to the entrance of the MD2 cavity, creating a metastable state before they fully enter the cavity. In the metastable state, (-)-nicotine established more stable interactions with the surrounding residues at the entrance of the MD2 cavity compared to those of (+)-nicotine. This highlights the crucial role of the MD2 cavity entrance in the chiral recognition of nicotine.

Thus, new targeted therapies are needed. FOXM1 is abundantly expressed in human cancers and implicated in protecting tumor cells from oxidative stress by reducing the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Aspirin, a prototypical anti-cancer agent with deleterious side effects, has been modified to release nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide, called NOSH-aspirin (NOSH-ASA), generating a 'safer' class of new anti-inflammatory agents. We evaluated NOSH-ASA against (ER)-negative breast cancer using cell lines and a xenograft mouse model. NOSH-ASA strongly inhibited growth of MDA-MB-231 and SKBR3 breast cancer cells with low IC(50)s of 90plus minus5 and 82plus minus5 nM, respectively, with marginal effects on a normal breast epithelial cell line. NOSH-ASA inhibited cell proliferation, caused G(0)/G(1) phase arrest, increased apoptosis, and was associated with increases in ROS. In MDA-MB-231 cell xenografts, NOSH-ASA reduced tumor size markedly, which was associated with reduced proliferation (decreased PCNA expression), induction of apoptosis (increased TUNEL positive cells), and increased ROS, while NF-kB and FoxM1 that were high in untreated xenografts were significantly reduced. mRNA data for FoxM1, p21 and CyclinD1 corroborated with the respective protein expressions and arrest of cells. Taken together, these molecular events contribute to NOSH-ASA mediated growth inhibition and apoptotic death of (ER)-negative breast cells in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, as a ROS-inducer and FOXM1-inhibitor, NOSH-ASA has potential as a targeted therapy.

We recently reported that GAT358, a CB(1)-NAM, blocked opioid-induced mesocorticolimbic dopamine release and reward via a CB(1)-allosteric mechanism of action. Whether a CB(1)-NAM dampens opioid-mediated therapeutic effects such as analgesia or alters other unwanted opioid side-effects remain unknown. Here, we characterized the effects of GAT358 on nociceptive behaviors in the presence and absence of morphine in male rats. We examined the impact of GAT358 on formalin-evoked pain behavior and Fos protein expression, a marker of neuronal activation, in the lumbar spinal cord. We also assessed the impact of GAT358 on morphine-induced slowing of colonic transit, tolerance, and withdrawal behaviors in male mice. GAT358 attenuated morphine antinociceptive tolerance without blocking acute antinociception and reduced morphine-induced slowing of colonic motility without impacting fecal boli production. GAT358 also produced antinociception in the presence and absence of morphine in the formalin model of inflammatory nociception and reduced the number of formalin-evoked Fos protein-like immunoreactive cells in the lumbar spinal cord.

In our earlier work, we showed that Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) has a crucial role in regulating opioid signaling in spinal cord; Hsp90 inhibition in spinal cord enhances opioid anti-nociception. Building on these findings, we injected the non-selective Hsp90 inhibitor KU-32 by the intrathecal route into male and female CD-1 mice, showing that morphine anti-nociceptive potency was boosted by 1.9-3.5-fold in acute and chronic pain models. At the same time, tolerance was reduced from 21-fold to 2.9 fold and established tolerance was rescued, while the potency of constipation and reward was unchanged. These results demonstrate that spinal Hsp90 inhibition can improve the therapeutic index of morphine. However, we also found that systemic non-selective Hsp90 inhibition blocked opioid pain relief. To avoid this effect, we used selective small molecule inhibitors and CRISPR gene editing to identify 3 Hsp90 isoforms active in spinal cord (Hsp90alpha, Hsp90beta, and Grp94) while only Hsp90alpha was active in brain. We thus hypothesized that a systemically delivered selective inhibitor to Hsp90beta or Grp94 could selectively inhibit spinal cord Hsp90 activity, resulting in enhanced opioid therapy.

RESULTS: OFA group required less morphine in the first 24 hours post-surgery (17.28+/-12.25 mg versus 27.96+/-19.75 mg, P<0.05). The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) was significantly lower in the OFA group. More patients in the OFA group required antihypertensive medications compared to patients in the OBA group (P<0.05). In the post anesthesia care unit, OFA patients had a significantly longer stay than OBA patients (114.1+/-49.33 min versus 89.96+/-30.71 min, P<0.05).

Serotonin syndrome occurred 24 hours after starting the linezolid use. Resistant hypertension was the main hemodynamic finding. It could not be controlled with amlodipine, valsartan, prazosin, and nitroglycerin infusion. Resistant hypertension and other symptoms of serotonin syndrome were resolved about 48 hours after discontinuation of linezolid use. The second case was a man with a history of kidney transplant, diabetes, and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU due to severe COVID-19 broad-spectrum antibiotics [linezolid, cefepime], and remdesivir was initiated. Following intubation, continuous infusion of fentanyl was used for sedation. Within 24 hours after fentanyl and linezolid initiation, severe agitation, eye clonus, hyperreflexia, hypertension [160-186 /90-110 mmHg], and tachycardia [>100/min] were noted.

In adult rodents, the delayed effects of stress can increase anxiety-like behavior. These effects, however, can be prevented with post-stress administration of corticosterone (CORT). The effectiveness of CORT in preventing adolescent stress-induced emotional behavior alterations in adulthood has yet to be investigated. OBJECTIVES: Here, we investigated the interactions between early adolescent stress and exogenous corticosterone on adult social, aversive, and drug-seeking behavior in mice, which are translationally related to symptoms associated with psychiatric and substance abuse disorders. METHODS AND RESULTS: A single administration of CORT in drinking water (400ug/mL) for 24 h after social defeat or context fear conditioning prevents defeat-induced social avoidance, alters fear processing, prevents adolescent stress-induced anhedonia, and prevents stress-potentiated morphine place preference in adulthood. Exogenous CORT did not immediately prevent stress-induced potentiation of morphine conditioned-place preference in adolescents but did so in adult mice. However, when administered to adolescent mice, CORT also prevented the incubation of morphine-conditioned place preference into adulthood. Lastly, exogenous CORT administration blunted endogenous corticosterone but was unrelated to freezing behavior during a fear test. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first demonstration of adolescent post-stress CORT promoting socio-emotional resilience and preventing drug-seeking behavior. Our data suggest elevated corticosterone after a stress experience promotes resilience for at least 40 days across the developmental transition from adolescence to adulthood and is effective for socio-emotional and drug-seeking behavior.

The mechanisms of the cause of IDA in this category of individuals are still largely unknown. Evidence is presented suggesting that a likely cause of IDA in this category of aspirin users is the chelation activity and increased excretion of iron caused by aspirin chelating metabolites (ACMs). It is estimated that 90% of oral aspirin is metabolized into about 70% of the ACMs salicyluric acid, salicylic acid, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid. All ACMs have a high affinity for binding iron and ability to mobilize iron from different iron pools, causing an overall net increase in iron excretion and altering iron balance. Interestingly, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid has been previously tested in iron-loaded thalassaemia patients, leading to substantial increases in iron excretion. The daily administration of low-dose aspirin for long-term periods is likely to enhance the overall iron excretion in small increments each time due to the combined iron mobilization effect of the ACM. In particular, IDA is likely to occur mainly in populations such as elderly vegetarian adults with meals low in iron content.

Here we explored the effects of biasing Gbetagamma signaling on tolerance development after chronic morphine treatment in vivo. We hypothesized that biasing Gbetagamma signaling with gallein could prevent activation of regulatory signaling pathways that result in tolerance to antinociceptive effects of MOR agonists. Gallein has been shown to bind to Gbetagamma and inhibit interactions of Gbetagamma with phospholipase-Cbeta3 (PLCbeta3) or G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) but not G-protein inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels.

The aim was to quantitatively analyze the efficacy and safety of perioperative TEAS on postoperative pain and recovery. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched through July 2022. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the perioperative application of TEAS in adults compared with sham-TEAS and/or non-TEAS were eligible. Cumulative analgesic consumption within 24 h and rest pain scores at 2, 6, 12, and 24 h postoperatively were the two co-primary outcomes. RESULTS: Seventy-six RCTs (n = 9,665 patients) were included. Patients treated with TEAS experienced a reduction in clinical importance in cumulative analgesic (morphine equivalent) consumption (WMD: -14.60 mg, 97.5% CI: -23.60 to -5.60; p < 0.001) and a reduction in statistical importance in rest pain scores at multiple time points within the first 24 postoperative hours. The secondary outcome analysis also identified clinically significant recovery benefits to TEAS during the first 24 h after surgery. Furthermore, TEAS could effectively reduce opioid-related side effects and did not increase serious side effects. CONCLUSION: This article describes current evidence about TEAS intervention on early postoperative pain and recovery. The results support the effectiveness of TEAS, but more high-quality evidence of clinical applicability is also needed.

This study aimed to evaluate the iatrogenic triad in the elderly and identify potential preventive measures to mitigate its occurrence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A preliminary observational study was conducted on 150 ambulatory elderly patients to assess potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs), polypharmacy, and drug interactions. The AGS Beers Criteria 2019, Polypharmacy, Medication Complexity Regimen Index (MRCI), and Micromedex (a drug information software) were used to assess the harmful triad. Before and after data collection, we observed, identified, and unfolded potential strategies to avoid the harmful triad in the elderly population. RESULTS: MRCI is 30.49 +/- 13.77, suggesting a moderate level of complexity in the drug regimens of elderly patients. Among the PIMs identified by the AGS Beer criteria for 2019, glimepiride (45) and diclofenac (23) were found to be the most frequently prescribed.

Here, we report an essential role of the potassium channel tetramerization domain (KCTD) protein 2, 5, and 17, especially the dominant isoform KCTD5 in regulating heterologous sensitization of AC1 and morphine dependence via working with cullin3 and the cullin-associated and neddylation-dissociated 1 (CAND1) protein. In cellular models, we observed enhanced association of KCTD5 with Gbeta and cullin3, along with elevated dissociation of Gbeta from AC1 as well as of CAND1 from cullin3 in heterologous sensitization of AC1. Given binding of CAND1 inhibits the neddylation of cullin3, we further elucidated that the enhanced interaction of KCTD5 with both Gbeta and cullin3 promoted the dissociation of CAND1 from cullin3, attenuated the inhibitory effect of CAND1 on cullin3 neddylation, ultimately resulted in heterologous sensitization of AC1. The paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) plays an important role in mediating morphine dependence.

This review analyzes data on efficacy, side effects, and safety of ITM and the pain control alternatives. RECENT FINDINGS: A comprehensive literature review was conducted to compare ITM with other analgesic techniques in post-cesarean patients. ITM was found to be as effective or better than other analgesic options, including bilateral quadratus lumborum block (QLB), opioid-free epidural analgesia (CSEA-EDA), and intravenous fentanyl. One study found that both ITM and oral analgesia were effective in pain control and that ITM caused fewer breakthrough pain events but had a longer duration and a greater rate of side effects than oral opioid analgesia. Commonly observed side effects of intrathecal opioids include nausea, vomiting, pruritus, and urinary retention, and it is thought that the adverse effects from intrathecal administration of opioids are short-lived. ITM may provide a decreased risk of DVT and coagulation by decreasing lower extremity weakness and numbness, thereby decreasing recovery time and increasing mobility.

This is likely related to a failure in proving the efficacy of alternative analgesics in clinical trials, despite strong evidence supporting the potential for effective analgesia through in vitro studies. While NaV1.7 and NaV1.8 channels have shown to be key components of pain perception, studies regarding pharmacological agents utilizing these channels as targets have largely failed to demonstrate the efficacy of these proposed analgesics when compared to current multimodal pain treatment regimens. RECENT FINDINGS: However, the novel NaV1.8 channel inhibitor, VX-548 has surpassed previously studied NaV1.8 inhibitors in clinical trials and continues to hold promise of a novel efficacious analgesic to potentially be utilized in multimodal pain treatment on postsurgical patients. Additionally, NaV1.8 is encoded by the SCN10A, which has been shown to be minimally expressed in the brain, suggesting a lower likelihood of adverse effects in the CNS, including dependence and abuse. Novel pharmacologic analgesics that are efficacious without the significant side effects associated with opioids have lacked meaningful development. However, recent clinical trials have shown promising results in the safety and efficacy of the pharmacological agent VX-548.

In our earlier work, we showed that Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) has a crucial role in regulating opioid signaling in spinal cord; Hsp90 inhibition in spinal cord enhances opioid anti-nociception. Building on these findings, we injected the non-selective Hsp90 inhibitor KU-32 by the intrathecal route into male and female CD-1 mice, showing that morphine anti-nociceptive potency was boosted by 1.9-3.5-fold in acute and chronic pain models. At the same time, tolerance was reduced from 21-fold to 2.9 fold and established tolerance was rescued, while the potency of constipation and reward was unchanged. These results demonstrate that spinal Hsp90 inhibition can improve the therapeutic index of morphine. However, we also found that systemic non-selective Hsp90 inhibition blocked opioid pain relief. To avoid this effect, we used selective small molecule inhibitors and CRISPR gene editing to identify 3 Hsp90 isoforms active in spinal cord (Hsp90alpha, Hsp90beta, and Grp94) while only Hsp90alpha was active in brain. We thus hypothesized that a systemically delivered selective inhibitor to Hsp90beta or Grp94 could selectively inhibit spinal cord Hsp90 activity, resulting in enhanced opioid therapy. We tested this hypothesis using intravenous delivery of KUNB106 (Hsp90beta) and KUNG65 (Grp94), showing that both drugs enhanced morphine anti-nociceptive potency while rescuing tolerance.

Tolerance, defined as the decrease in analgesic activity after repeated use, remains a vital therapeutic obstacle as it increases the likelihood of dose escalation and potentially lethal side effects like respiratory depression. Previous experiments have shown that the endomorphin-1 analog, ZH853, is a specific micro-opioid receptor agonist with reduced side effects like tolerance and glial activation following chronic central administration in pain-naive animals. Here, we investigated the effects of chronic, peripheral administration of micro-opioid receptor agonists following neuropathic injury. Though micro-opioids are effective at reducing neuropathic pain, they are not recommended for first-line treatment due to negative side effects. Compared with chronic morphine, chronic ZH853 treatment led to decreased tolerance and reduced glial activation. Following twice-daily intravenous injections, morphine was less potent and had a shorter duration of antinociception compared with ZH853. Chronic morphine, but not chronic ZH853, elevated markers of activation/inflammation of astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein), microglia (ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1), the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase p38 (pp38). By contrast, chronic ZH853 reduced ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha relative to both morphine and vehicle, suggesting anti-inflammatory properties with respect to these markers. Glial fibrillary acidic protein and pp38 were not significantly different from vehicle but were significantly lower than morphine.

This study aims to compare the efficacy and safety of intravenous (IV) meperidine and morphine is treatment of MAB-related rigors, filling a significant gap in the literature. METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study which reviewed patients either inpatient or within outpatient infusion centers from January 2015 to January 2024. Patients receiving IV 2 mg morphine or 25 mg meperidine for MAB-related rigors were included. The primary outcome was defined as the number of opioid doses required for rigors ablation. Secondary outcomes included rates of naloxone administration and documented sedation. RESULTS: A total of 1251 administration events were screened, of which 127 and 26 rigor events were in the meperidine and morphine cohorts, respectively, were included. A majority of both cohorts required only one dose of either agent for rigors ablation with <20% of either cohort requiring 2 or more doses (p = 0.539). Low rates of sedation were observed in both groups. CONCLUSION: Both meperidine and morphine effectively manage MAB-related rigors within minimal safety concerns.

This study aims to investigate the impact of inappropriate antibiotic use on the dissemination and exacerbation of antibiotic resistance in ESBL-EC and explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. Through experimental analysis, we propose a hypothesis that inappropriate antibiotic use may exacerbate resistance by affecting vesicle formation and protein secretion. Experimental results demonstrate that under the influence of amoxicillin, the concentration of proteins secreted in outer membrane vehicles (OMVs) by ESBL-EC significantly increases, along with a significant upregulation in the expression of the CTX-M-55-type Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (CTX-M-55). Proteomic analysis and differential gene knockout experiments identified the key protein YdcZ, associated with OMVs formation and protein transportation in ESBL-EC under amoxicillin treatment. Further investigations reveal direct interactions between YdcZ and other proteins (YdiH and BssR). Upon ydcz gene knockout, a significant decrease in protein concentration within OMVs is observed, accompanied by a noticeable reduction in protection against sensitive bacteria. These findings suggest a critical role of YdcZ in regulating the process of protein transportation to OMVs in ESBL-EC under the influence of amoxicillin. In summary, our research uncovers the significant role of inappropriate antibiotic use in promoting the secretion of OMVs by ESBL-EC, aiding the survival of antibiotic-sensitive bacteria in the vicinity of infection sites.

This study aimed to investigate the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of combining these two beta-lactams against MRSA strains. METHODS: Fourteen representative prevalent MRSA strains with diverse sequence types (STs) were tested with a combination of amoxicillin and cefdinir, using chequerboard and time-kill assays. The Galleria mellonella larvae infection model was used to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of this dual combination against the community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) strain USA300 and the hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA) strain COL. RESULTS: The chequerboard assay revealed a synergistic activity of the dual amoxicillin/cefdinir combination against all tested MRSA strains, with fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) values below 0.5 and at least a 4-fold reduction in the MICs of both antibiotics. Time-kill assays demonstrated synergistic bactericidal activity of this dual combination against the MRSA strain USA300 and strain COL. Moreover, in vivo studies showed that the administration of amoxicillin/cefdinir combination to G. mellonella larvae infected with MRSA strains significantly improved the survival rate up to 82%, which was comparable to the efficacy of vancomycin.

METHODS: To achieve this goal, we developed Tet1-LNP (morphine), a neural-targeting lipid nanoparticle encapsulating morphine that could specifically activate the peripheral opioid receptor in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and significantly reduce the side effects caused by the activation of opioid receptors in the brain. Tet1-LNP (morphine) were successfully prepared using the thin-film hydration method. In vitro, Tet1-LNP (morphine) uptake was assessed in differentiated neuron-like PC-12 cells and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) primary cells. The uptake of Tet1-LNP (morphine) in the DRGs and the brain was assessed in vivo. Von Frey filament and Hargreaves tests were used to assess the antinociception of Tet1-LNP (morphine) in the chronic constriction injury (CCI) neuropathic pain model.

With multisource data, this study sought to determine the effects of morphine interaction with P2Y12 inhibitors on major adverse outcomes comprehensively, and identify the warning indicators. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Interaction signals were sought in 187,919 safety reports from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database, utilizing reporting odds ratios (repOR). In a cohort of 5240 acute coronary syndrome patients, the analyses were validated, and the biological effects of warning indicators were further studied with Mendelian randomization and mediation analysis. RESULTS: Potential risk of renal system adverse events in patients cotreated with morphine is significantly higher in FAERS (repOR 4.83, 95% CI 4.42-5.28, false discovery rate adjusted-P =3.55*10(-209)). The analysis of in-house patient cohorts validated these results with an increased risk of acute kidney injury (adjusted OR: 1.65; 95% CI: 1.20 to 2.26), and we also found a risk of myocardial infarction in patients treated with morphine (adjusted OR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.14 to 2.11).

The identification of new targets to treat postoperative pain is necessary. There is an association of polymorphisms in the Ca(v)2.3 gene with postoperative pain and opioid consumption. Our study aimed to identify Ca(v)2.3 as a potential target to treat postoperative pain and to reduce opioid-related side effects. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: A plantar incision model was established in adult male and female C57BL/6 mice. Ca(v)2.3 expression was detected by qPCR and suppressed by siRNA treatment. The antinociceptive efficacy and safety of a Ca(v)2.3 blocker-alone or together with morphine-was also assessed after surgery. KEY RESULTS: Paw incision in female and male mice caused acute nociception and increased Ca(v)2.3 mRNA expression in the spinal cord but not in the incised tissue. Intrathecal treatment with siRNA against Ca(v)2.3, but not with a scrambled siRNA, prevented the development of surgery-induced nociception in both male and female mice, with female mice experiencing long-lasting effects. High doses of i.t. SNX-482, a Ca(v)2.3 channel blocker, or morphine injected alone, reversed postoperative nociception but also induced side effects. A combination of lower doses of morphine and SNX-482 mediated a long-lasting reversal of postsurgical pain in female and male mice.

In adult rodents, the delayed effects of stress can increase anxiety-like behavior. These effects, however, can be prevented with post-stress administration of corticosterone (CORT). The effectiveness of CORT in preventing adolescent stress-induced emotional behavior alterations in adulthood has yet to be investigated. OBJECTIVES: Here, we investigated the interactions between early adolescent stress and exogenous corticosterone on adult social, aversive, and drug-seeking behavior in mice, which are translationally related to symptoms associated with psychiatric and substance abuse disorders. METHODS AND RESULTS: A single administration of CORT in drinking water (400ug/mL) for 24 h after social defeat or context fear conditioning prevents defeat-induced social avoidance, alters fear processing, prevents adolescent stress-induced anhedonia, and prevents stress-potentiated morphine place preference in adulthood. Exogenous CORT did not immediately prevent stress-induced potentiation of morphine conditioned-place preference in adolescents but did so in adult mice. However, when administered to adolescent mice, CORT also prevented the incubation of morphine-conditioned place preference into adulthood. Lastly, exogenous CORT administration blunted endogenous corticosterone but was unrelated to freezing behavior during a fear test. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first demonstration of adolescent post-stress CORT promoting socio-emotional resilience and preventing drug-seeking behavior. Our data suggest elevated corticosterone after a stress experience promotes resilience for at least 40 days across the developmental transition from adolescence to adulthood and is effective for socio-emotional and drug-seeking behavior.

Here we explored the effects of biasing Gbetagamma signaling on tolerance development after chronic morphine treatment in vivo. We hypothesized that biasing Gbetagamma signaling with gallein could prevent activation of regulatory signaling pathways that result in tolerance to antinociceptive effects of MOR agonists. Gallein has been shown to bind to Gbetagamma and inhibit interactions of Gbetagamma with phospholipase-Cbeta3 (PLCbeta3) or G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) but not G-protein inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels.

Furthermore, TEAS could effectively reduce opioid-related side effects and did not increase serious side effects. CONCLUSION: This article describes current evidence about TEAS intervention on early postoperative pain and recovery. The results support the effectiveness of TEAS, but more high-quality evidence of clinical applicability is also needed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: J99 reference strains and 19 clinical isolates of H. pylori with various antibiotic resistance phenotypes were used. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were carried out using the microdilution method in 96-well plates. The activity of 15 possible combinations of two antibiotics including amoxicillin, clarithromycin (CLA), levofloxacin, rifampicin, tetracycline, and metronidazole was determined for all strains by the checkerboard method.

Pain after pediatric tonsillectomy is common, often severe, and undertreated. There is no consensus on the optimal management of perioperative tonsillectomy pain. Methadone, with an elimination half-life of 1-2 days, has a longer duration of effect than short-duration opioids such as fentanyl. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the intraoperative use of methadone for pediatric tonsillectomy. It tested the hypothesis that methadone would result in less postoperative opioid use compared with short-duration opioids in children post-tonsillectomy. METHODS: This double-bind, randomized, parallel group trial in children (3-17 years) undergoing tonsillectomy compared single-dose intravenous methadone (0.1 mg/kg then 0.15 mg/kg age-ideal body weight, in a dose escalation paradigm) versus as-needed short-duration opioid (fentanyl) controls. Opioid use, pain, and side effects were assessed in-hospital and 7 days postoperatively via electronic surveys. The primary outcome was total 7-day opioid use in oral morphine equivalents per kilogram (OME/kg).

Different regimens have been used for H. pylori eradication. We aimed to compare the efficacy of two different regimens as first-line H. pylori eradication regimens, in an area with high antibiotic resistance. METHODS: In this RCT, we assigned 223 patients with H. pylori infection, who were naive to treatment. They were randomly divided into two groups to receive either 12-day concomitant quadruple therapy (consisting of pantoprazole 40 mg, amoxicillin 1 g, clarithromycin 500 mg, and metronidazole 500 mg every 12 hours) or 14-day high dose dual therapy (consisting of esomeprazole 40 mg and amoxicillin 1 g TDS).

In this study, we investigated the in vitro binding and functional activities to the human MOR and the in vivo pharmacology of LENART01 in mice after subcutaneous administration. In vitro binding assays showed LENART01 to bind and be selective to the human MOR over the other opioid receptor subtypes and delta, kappa and nociceptin receptors.
